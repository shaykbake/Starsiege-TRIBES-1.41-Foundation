A Foundation Mod for Modding Tribes 1.41

This will be a casually updated base 1.41 mod with additional functions and changes in file structure to - in my opinion - help make modding in Tribes 1.41 easier.

Similar mods have been done in Tribes 1.11, such as Foundation/Foundation II and Beginner_Mod.

Initial commits are just the original base mod as distributed with 1.40/1.41 versions of Tribes.
