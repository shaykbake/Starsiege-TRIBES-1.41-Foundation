# Starsiege: TRIBES 1.41 Foundation
A Foundation Mod for Modding Tribes 1.41

This will be a casually updated base 1.41 mod with additional functions and changes in file structure to - in my opinion - help make modding in Tribes 1.41 easier.

Similar mods have been done in Tribes 1.11, such as Foundation/Foundation II and Beginner_Mod. I chose to adopt the Foundation moniker given that it was the project of this type I ever came across for Tribes and felt it would be a sort of show of respect. 

Initial commits are just the original base mod as distributed with 1.40/1.41 versions of Tribes.

Feel free to discuss this project or report any issues in the {LS} Long Shots team [forums](https://longshots.mk0.pw/forums/) and [Discord](https://longshots.mk0.pw/discord/).
